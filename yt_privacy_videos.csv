DuckDuckGo Privacy Review | NordVPN'],"['🔥World’s fastest VPN [TESTED] | 5,200+ servers in 60 countries🔥\n🔒Instant privacy from anywhere in the world 🌎\nCLICK HERE for NordVPN YouTube DEAL 👉🏻 https://content.nordvpn.com/3EFIBr0\n\nIs DuckDuckGo really safe? DuckDuckGo says it offers its users a more private browsing experience. Yet the recent controversy about this search engine created worry among its users. Through a thorough investigation, researcher Zach Edwards found a gap in DuckDuckGo’s claim of maximum privacy. \nWhat was the problem? Watch this DuckDuckGo review and find out.\n\n***\n\nContents of the video:\n\n00:18 What is DuckDuckGo?\n00:36 DuckDuckGo vs. Google \n01:20 DuckDuckGo privacy scandal\n\n***\n\nThe video starts by mentioning the recent controversy with DuckDuckGo. It then explains what DuckDuckGO is. It’s a search engine designed to keep users’ online privacy. The browser is available both on desktop\nand mobile browsers. DuckDuckGo is compared with widely used search engines such as Google. Search engines like Google use third-party tracking and store users’ data. In return, it gives users more personalization and auto-suggestions based on their online searches in the past. \n\nDuckDuckGo, on the other hand, provides users with more anonymity. The browser neither tracks their habits nor does it target or profile search results. DuckDuckGo also has additional benefits like readily available weather data, extra features for developers, and loan calculators. After comparing the browsers, the elephant in the room is addressed –DuckDuckGo’s scandal. \n\nThrough a thorough investigation, researcher Zach Edwards found a gap in DuckDuckGo’s claim of maximum privacy. While the browser blocked platforms like Google Chrome and Facebook from tracking, it allowed trackers through Microsoft-owned properties such as LinkedIn and Bing. \nThis fact made many users concerned. It was a clear case of hypocrisy – DuckDuckGo promised more privacy and then took it away by signing a deal with a high-tech company. \nAfter the news came to light, DuckDuckGo assured customers that the trackers don’t allow Microsoft to monitor individual users or link search activity to specific people. Yet, this whole situation is not a catastrophe. Most of DuckDuckGo’s statements still hold true. And since the scandal, the company has been super transparent about its actions, promising more control over  Microsoft trackers. \n\nSo if users are looking for a private browser, DuckDuckGo remains a good alternative to Google and other major search engines. For extra safety,  a VPN is recommended.\n\n***\n\nAbout NordVPN\n\nNordVPN is part of Nord Security, an online security company that aims to provide users with all the necessary online security tools.

But can an email be truly anonymous? We examine how a private email service works and why you need one, and provide our recommendations. Watch the video to find out about top 5 secure email providers in 2022.\n\n🔔 Subscribe to our YouTube channel and get the latest content: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSZhRxyloC-qzURiOa3vbFQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\n***\n\nContents of the video:\n\n00:00 Intro\n00:45 What is an anonymous email service?\n01:16 Who needs to send an anonymous email?\n01:38 ProtonMail\n02:18 Tutanota\n03:07 Secure Email\n03:18 Guerilla Mail\n03:41 Mailfence\n04:03 Outro\n\n***\nAn anonymous email is one that can\'t be traced back to you. To be considered private, email services should meet a couple of requirements.\n\nThey should hide your identity from recipients. They should encrypt your messages and hide all other details like your device\'s name or IP address.\n\nFinally, the anonymous email service provider should keep no records of your personal data. But why go through the trouble of setting up an anonymous email account?\n\nIt depends on your needs. You might be a journalist writing about sensitive topics. You could be an activist fighting for human rights. You might be a whistleblower.\n\nYou might be living in a country with an oppressive regime that monitors everything you do online. Or you may simply care about your privacy and security to a greater extent than the average joe.\n\nLet\'s look over the best free anonymous email providers in 2022. ProtonMail. It\'s one of the most popular secure email providers. \n\nProtonMail encrypts your emails with PGP encryption before they leave your device. With a zero-knowledge policy in place, no one can snoop on your messages. (Not even ProtonMail employees.) \n\nUnfortunately, ProtonMail doesn\'t encrypt your metadata, headers, or subject lines. You don\'t need to enter any personally identifiable information to create an account. You can also send self-destructing messages.\n\nA free account will give you plenty of storage. If you need extra features, you can opt for a paid service. \n\nAnother popular choice in the online security community is Tutanota. Tutanota encrypts your entire inbox, including your email subject lines and contacts list.\n\nTutanota provides end-to-end encryption between users. You can also send encrypted messages to non-users with a pre-shared password that decrypts them. \n\nYou don\'t need to enter any personal information to create your account, and the free plan gives you a generous amount of storage. Tutanota also strips your IP from your emails so that even if someone manages to snoop on your traffic, they will not be able to locate you. Since Tutanota\'s software is open source, anyone can check its code to confirm its security.\n\nSecure Email secures your emails with powerful encryption to make sure that no one can snoop on them in transit. You don\'t need to share any personal data to create a Secure Email account. The service doesn\'t log your IP address, meaning that it has no data about you that could be passed to third parties.\n\nGuerilla Mail has been around for over a decade. It provides a free and disposable email address that lets you privately send and receive email. The neat ""scramble address"" feature creates a randomized address. No personal data is required to create an account. If you\'re still worried about it being traced, you can send anonymous messages without an account. \n\nMailfence is a secure email provider offering OpenPGP, the most widely used email encryption standard. It also offers features such as calendar, contacts, and documents. \n\nIt lets you use aliases, which are different email addresses for a single account. Mailfence also filters your incoming emails to protect your privacy and avoid spam.\n\n***\n\nAbout NordVPN\n\nNordVPN is part of Nord Security, an online security company that aims to provide users with all the necessary online security tools.

The US Supreme Court has overturned the landmark decision. In addition to affecting freedoms and protections in the real world,  this decision will also influence the digital one.\n\n\n***\n\nContents of the video:\n\n00:00 Intro\n00:30 Roe v. Wade repeal will affect your digital privacy\n01:04 Will deleting fertility-tracking apps help?\n01:26 Response from tech giants\n02:04 Outro\n\n***\n\nIn addition to affecting freedoms and protections in the real world,  this decision will also influence the digital one.\n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation has argued: “Today's decision deprives millions of people of a fundamental right, and also underscores the importance of fair and meaningful protections for data privacy.”\n\nIn this video, we review the news and opinions about how the Court’s decision may infringe on digital rights. EFF stresses that if you’re now seeking or offering an abortion, you must assume that any data you provide in the process may be sought by law enforcement.\n\nIt suggests you use encrypted messaging, carefully review privacy settings on your apps, and turn off location tracking for apps that don’t require it. The Wall Street Journal reports that period trackers and fertility apps are working on ways to anonymize user data. \n\nData held by these services could be used against people in states where abortion may be criminalized.  However, deleting period-tracking and fertility apps won’t protect your data in most cases.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that since tech giants have amassed private data on billions of people, authorities around the world have been increasingly targeting it.  \n\nNow, this data can be used to find and prosecute people getting or abetting abortions. “We live our lives online, we leave digital breadcrumbs of our prior activities, and of course those are going to be caught up in abortion investigations,” said Catherine Crump, a law professor at UC-Berkeley’s law school.\n\nWhile tech giants are keeping silent, their employees are internally agitating to take measures to protect users.\n\n***\n\nAbout NordVPN\n\nNordVPN is part of Nord Security, an online security company that aims to provide users with all the necessary online security tools.

You’re making it easy for cyberstalkers.\n\n#2 Social profiling\nSocial profiling means assessing a person based on their interaction and influence on social media. An estimated 43% of employers have decided not hire someone based on information found online. 40% of employers use social media to screen candidates, including their social conduct. Watch out what you’re sharing publicly. \n\n#3 Third-party information sharing\nThis is where the tracking comes in. When you visit a website, you get cookies. We are talking about digital trackers that can identify your behaviour patterns online. Do you see ads for something you have just been looking at online? That’s your cookie.\n\n#4 Warrantless searches\nAny person who willingly makes information public is not protected by the Fourth Amendment in the US. That means accessing that information requires no warrant. The NSA is known to have worked with Facebook, Google and others to get users’ email content, search history, live chats and file transfers.

IXgUIVeclGY,['Online security and privacy predictions for 2020 | NordVPN'],"[""This video overviews Top 5 online security and privacy predictions for 2020. \nWith the decline in online privacy and cyber attacks getting more sophisticated and dangerous, Internet users need to learn how to protect themselves when going online. Most of the online threats can be avoided if we stick to good digital hygiene habits: don’t click on suspicious emailed links, don’t download from unofficial app marketplaces, always use strong passwords, don’t share too much on social media and be generally cautious when going online – common sense is always helpful.\n\nAnd now let's take a look at the online security and privacy predictions on what’s to come in 2020.\n\nExpect more cloud data breaches\n\nIn 2019, we witnessed Capital One and other huge cloud-based breaches. With a continuous data stream cloud-bound from consumers and organizations, the cloud will keep its position of an attractive target for cybercriminals. And while protective measures often fall behind, data breaches in 2020 will likely leave you disappointed again, but not surprised. \n\nCybercriminals will want your healthcare data\n\nMedical records are becoming more valuable than credit card data. Possession of healthcare  info opens up new ways for cybercriminals to scam patients and their relatives. And if medical IoT devices and databases are secured poorly, this sensitive data is not that difficult for eager hackers to access. \n\n5G will bring new security risks\n\n5G is rolling out across the world, promising blazing speeds, connection reliability and… new risks to your data security. There already are known flaws in the process of an automatic switch from cellular to Wi-Fi on a mobile device. Attackers will likely be searching for ways to snag your data during the 5G-to-Wi-Fi handover. \n\nPhishing attacks will intensify\n\nWith millions of compromised credentials and even phishing kits available on the dark web, it’s easier than ever for cybercriminals to run sophisticated phishing attacks. So stay sharp-eyed in 2020 – especially when it comes to suspicious emails in your inbox.\n\nRansomware, again\n\nOne of the most profitable tactics for hackers will continue to evolve in 2020. What are the main targets? Industries that can’t operate with downtime: healthcare services, government institutions and energy companies.""]","[['VPN', 'NordVPN', 'nord vpn', 'using vpn', 'cybersecurity predictions 2020', 'online safety 2020', 'cyber security', 'cybersecurity 2020', 'using nordvpn', 'online trends 2020', 'safety trends 2020', 'nordvpn app', 'vpn app', 'data breach', 'cyber attacks', 'cybercriminals', 'phishing attacks', 'security risks', 'ransomware']]",['1725'],['36']

And it all begins with a VPN — an everyday cybersecurity tool that protects your internet connection. A VPN routes all your internet traffic through a secure tunnel — so even if someone intercepts your internet traffic, they can’t see its contents. \n\n***\n\nContents:\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:06 International VPN Day\n0:17 The benefits of a VPN\n0:49 Securing your passwords\n1:08 Avoiding online scams\n1:32 Outro\n\n***\n\nA VPN is especially useful for anyone who uses public Wi-Fi hotspots — meaning all of us. Public Wi-Fi is notoriously unsafe. For example, it’s hard to tell if you’re connecting to a legitimate hotspot or one set up by a cybercriminal. You can’t be sure you're safe on such a network — unless you’re using a VPN. \n\nNext tip. Don’t use the same password for everything. It’s like using the same lock for your car, apartment, and storage. Instead, create strong and unique passwords for every online account. Password managers will be a great help here — they generate strong passwords and remember them for you. \n\nFinally: avoiding online scams. Do not click on a link unless you trust the source. And do not enter your credentials on shady websites. \n\nRead emails and the websites you visit carefully. If they look poorly written, if the design seems off, they could have been set up by scammers. \n\nUnfortunately, some scam websites are very convincing — it’s sometimes impossible to spot any flaws. That’s where NordVPN’s CyberSec feature comes in, as it automatically blocks known malicious websites.\n\n***\nAbout NordVPN\n\nNordVPN is part of Nord Security, an online security company that aims to provide our users with all the necessary online security tools.

Thanks to one of these advanced solutions — NordLynx, a brand new tunneling solution — NordVPN has become the fastest VPN on the planet, as confirmed by the latest speed tests.  \n\nWhat is a VPN? How VPN works? \n\nA virtual private network (or simply — VPN) encrypts online traffic and enhances privacy by changing IP address and virtual location. It does so by routing all your internet traffic through a remote server. NordVPN offers over 5000 servers in 59 countries. It’s especially important to have VPN protection when you connect to public Wi-Fi. Public hotspots are inherently unsafe — cybercriminals can easily compromise them or set up fake hotspots to lure unsuspecting victims. You should always use NordVPN before connecting to public Wi-Fi.\n\nNordVPN is available on every major platform. You can use NordVPN on your laptop (Windows, macOS apps) or download it on your phone (Android, iOS apps). There’s also a NordVPN app for Android TV and Linux, while lightweight extensions for Chrome and Firefox can secure your browsing in an instant. \n\n***\n🔥Grab the International VPN Day offer here: https://content.nordvpn.com/3B6k4qj\n***\n\n#InternationalVPNDay #CybersecurityTips #NordVPN\n\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-\nTop 3 Online Security Myths | NordVPN\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbCuqoQ62tw\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-""]","[['VPN', 'NordVPN', 'International VPN day', 'Cybersecurity tips', 'Nord VPN', 'free vpn', 'best vpn', 'best free vpn', 'virtual private network', 'Awareness month', 'education', 'National Privacy test', 'Privacy', 'freedom', 'censorship', 'Passwords', 'VPN day', 'internet privacy', 'cyber security', 'security', 'internet security', 'online privacy', 'technology', 'internet']]",['1024'],['31']

Leaked documents reveal how Joe Biden’s former aide Jay Carney led a lobbying campaign in the US to kill dozens of privacy protections in 25 states. His mission was to “change or block US and EU regulation/legislation that would impede growth for Alexa-powered devices.” In one draft of a 2015 memo, Amazon communications executive Drew Herdener helped Carney outline the aggressive style of their strategy, claiming that they wanted policymakers and press to fear them. Following the news, five members of Congress called for federal consumer-privacy legislation. This comes just after a scathing report by Wired, which exposed the company’s lax data security measures that have led to snooping and data leaks. You can read more about it on our blog here: https://nordvpn.com/lt/blog/amazon-data-security-report/ \n\nSpeaking of sloppy privacy, let’s move on to Facebook. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, announced postponing the roll-out of default end-to-end encryption until 2023. Meta’s head of safety told the press that the company was taking its time to get this right. It’s worth noting that WhatsApp is already encrypted by default, and Messenger has the ‘Secret Conversation’ option, but it’s only available on mobile.\nIn scarier, sci-fi-type news, researchers ask the terrifying question of whether advertisers could hack your dreams. A trio of scientists from Harvard, MIT, and the University of Montreal warned that 77% of marketers were planning to use “dreamtech” advertising in the next three years. Two of the three researchers previously worked on a device designed to communicate with people asleep. The so-called ‘dream hacking’ can have a positive impact on people, for example, treating PTSD. But the scientists say that the Federal Trade Commission should update rules against subliminal messages in advertising to ban dream hacking.\n\nIn another scary news this week, flaws in recent MediaTek chips left 37% of the world’s mobile and IoT devices open to snooping. The vulnerabilities could have potentially enabled hackers to steal audio-related information. But don’t throw away your phone just yet. Since the announcement last week, the company said it had fixed the issues and hadn’t found any evidence of malicious exploitation of the flaws.\n\nLast Monday, web hosting company GoDaddy disclosed a data breach affecting 1.2 million WordPress users.\nAccording to GoDaddy, an unknown party gained access to the data on September 6, 2021. So far, the exposed information includes emails and customer numbers of over 1 million active and inactive users. It’s unclear what the intruder did with the data or if more sensitive information was exposed.\n\nThat’s it for this week folks, stay safe out there!\n\n***\n\n\nAbout NordVPN\nNordVPN is the world’s leading VPN provider and a flagship service of Nord Security.

Here’s how it works in detail. When you connect to a VPN server, it applies an encryption protocol to all data you send and receive. It creates a secure tunnel for your data to travel between you and its destination. To make sure each data packet is secure, a VPN wraps it in another, outer packet and then encrypts it through encapsulation. That’s how the VPN tunnel keeps your data safe during transfer. When the data arrives at the server, the outer packet is decrypted. \n\nA VPN’s workings are complex, but using a VPN isn’t. You don’t need to be tech-savvy to use NordVPN — simply open the app, click Quick Connect, and you’re done!\n\nYou can use NordVPN on 6 devices at the same time on every major platform: Android, Windows, macOS, iOS, and Linux.

So, naturally, it’s surrounded by many myths, making us have misconceptions about how things work. However, believing in some myths can make us more vulnerable to cyberthreats. In this myth-busting video, we will debunk the three most common cyber security myths. \n\n***\n\n🔔 Subscribe to get the latest content: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSZhRxyloC-qzURiOa3vbFQ?sub_confirmation=1 \n\n***\n\nContents of the video:\n\n00:09 I have nothing to hide\n00:48 Only naive users get scammed\n01:13 I don’t go to dodgy websites, so I’m safe\n\n***\n\nDue to the intangible nature of cyberthreats, we often think that they are not real. We also sometimes think that cybercriminals target only high-profile or public people, but not ordinary citizens. Also, we tend to overestimate our cyber awareness, thinking we are too smart to get hacked, but that’s not really true.\n\nMyths are exciting, but sometimes it’s better to know the truth. Here are top 3 cybersecurity myths we’ll debunk for you. Myth number one. I have nothing to hide. To debunk this myth, just imagine your digital environment as a physical one. Most likely, you don’t do anything top-secret at home, but you wouldn’t want anyone monitoring your daily activities through a surveillance camera or by peeping through your window.  Your online home actually has no walls - internet service providers can monitor your actions.  And so can cybercriminals, who can even steal your passwords. What is worse, huge corporations like Facebook or Google profit from your personal data. So even if you have nothing to hide, you definitely have a right to online privacy.\n\nMyth number two. Only naive users get scammed. Actually, scammers can fool even high-profile executives and senior professionals. And their techniques are getting more and more sophisticated. Scammers do extensive research to impersonate legitimate employees or representatives. They can also use employees to extract sensitive information. So, random poorly typed emails asking you to transfer some money are not the only scam technique. Criminals sharpen their tools too and can trick you very sneakily.\n\nMyth number three. I don’t visit dodgy websites so I’m safe. Well, even a very reliably looking website can be a hacker’s tool.  A hacker can also inject malicious scripts into legitimate websites without their owners’ knowledge. Moreover, many of the websites and services we use daily, including Facebook and Google, experienced massive data leaks in the past, so there is a high chance of getting exposed just by having an account on any of the mainstream platforms.\nHope these myths will help you to rethink your security practices and make your online time much safer.\n\n***\nAbout NordVPN\n\nNordVPN is part of Nord Security, an online security company that aims to provide users with all the necessary online security tools.

However, it is still not known who is behind the attacks.\n\nCybersecurity experts claim that cybercriminals started to exploit the NFT hype to trick victims into downloading password-stealing malware and then hijack their devices. NFTs (or non-fungible tokens) are digital tokens that use the blockchain to verify the ownership and authenticity of digital items.\n\nResearchers found a strange-looking Excel sheet with the NFT info used to spread the so-called BitRAT malware.\n\nBitRAT is a remote-access Trojan that first emerged in 2020. It can steal credentials from apps and browsers, log keystrokes, and download malicious files.\n\nThe government of India ordered the ban of 54 Chinese apps due to national security threats. The blacklist includes various beauty apps, online games, video editors, and other applications.\n\nBy June, India had already banned such apps as TikTok, WeChat, and Helo due concerns about user data collection.\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers have been hit by a ransomware attack. Hackers claim they stole the football team’s financial data.\n\nBlackByte, the group behind the attack, posted some of the team’s stolen documents on the dark web. However, the gang didn’t make any ransom demands. \n\nThe NFL team states that the attack disrupted some of its network systems and that it has already hired a cybersecurity team for assistance.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ukraine experienced another cyberattack knocking down the online networks of Ukraine's defense ministry and two banks.\n\nA DDoS attack disrupted the activities of websites of these organizations.

Everything outside LAN is the Wider Area Network, also known as WAN. Usually, external devices from WAN can’t access devices on LAN unless you let them via port forwarding.\n\nBut UPnP allows apps and other devices on LAN to open and close ports automatically to connect with each other. So UPnP-enabled devices can join a network automatically. But this convenience opens the door to various cybersecurity vulnerabilities.\n\nUPnP doesn’t use authorization or authentication — it assumes that devices trying to connect are trustworthy. That’s how hackers can find backdoors into your network. Cybercriminals can discover your router on WAN and pretend to be your device to gain access to your home network. Once inside hackers can get remote access to other gadgets or install malware on your devices.\n\nThat’s why we recommend you disable UPnP, unless it’s necessary for your home network. \n\n***\nAbout NordVPN\n\nNordVPN is the world’s leading VPN provider and a flagship service of Nord Security.

For targeted individuals, cyberstalking can turn into a living nightmare. But knowing about how it works can help.\n\nThe motivation of such behavior may vary: it can be personal, corporate, or voyeuristic. But whatever the reason, stalking causes great discomfort and fear for its target. And cyberstalkers are usually persistent in their actions, as opposed to one-time online bullies. \n\nWhat is more dangerous is that they could use online location services, hack your camera or doorbell to intrude on your offline private space.\n\nHowever, there are measures to reduce their luck. You should minimize the personal data you post on social media and adjust your privacy settings. Also, use strong passwords and encrypt your online traffic with a VPN so that no one could intercept it. \n\n***\n\nNordVPN is the fastest VPN on the planet and a leader in online security. \nWhat is a VPN? VPN stands for virtual private network — it’s a tool that protects your online activity by encrypting your traffic and changing your virtual location and IP address. \n\nHow a VPN works\n\nWhen using a VPN, you route all your internet traffic through a remote server. Here’s how it works in detail. When you connect to a VPN server, it applies an encryption protocol to all data you send and receive. It creates a secure tunnel for your data to travel between you and its destination. To make sure each data packet is secure, a VPN wraps it in another, outer packet and then encrypts it through encapsulation. That’s how the VPN tunnel keeps your data safe during transfer. When the data arrives at the server, the outer packet is decrypted. \n\nA VPN’s workings are complex, but using a VPN isn’t. You don’t need to be tech-savvy to use NordVPN — simply open the app, click Quick Connect, and you’re done!\n\nYou can use NordVPN on 6 devices at the same time on every major platform: Android, Windows, macOS, iOS, and Linux.

In what might turn out to be the biggest data leak in recorded history, hackers claim to have 23 terabytes of data stolen from the Shanghai police database.\n\n***\n\n🔔 Subscribe to get the latest content: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSZhRxyloC-qzURiOa3vbFQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\n***\n\nContents:\n\n00:00 Intro\n00:07 China data leak\n00:30 The forum post\n00:42 The stolen data\n01:05 “Key persons” blacklist\n01:40 Surveillance in China\n02:05 Censorship of the leak\n02:54 Outro\n\n***\n\nLet’s talk about China. Last week, the country dominated the cybernews headlines following a massive data leak of nearly one billion Chinese citizens. While the story is still developing, the leak is potentially the biggest in recorded history because of the size and the scope of information exposed. The worst part? The victims may never even hear about it.\n\nThe news of the leak broke two weeks ago, when a mysterious user or group, ChinaDan, claimed to have stolen records from the Shanghai police department, on the hacker forum Breach Forums. The post was offering to sell more than 23 terabytes of data for 10 bitcoin, equivalent to about $200,000. The post by ChinaDan also released a sample containing 750,000 records. The data in the sample includes names, national identification and phone numbers, medical records, details from police reports, and other information. The alleged hackers said that several billion police reports — from thefts to fights to domestic violence, dating from the late 1990s to 2019 — were included in the leak.\n\nWhat’s more troubling, some of the people in the leaked records were labeled “key persons.” \nAccording to The New York Times, this so-called blacklist includes citizens with mental illness, convicted criminals, fugitives, drug users, petitioners, suspected terrorists, political agitators, and threats to social stability.\n\nChina is notorious when it comes to keeping tabs on its citizens. More than half of all surveillance cameras in the world are located in China. The government is also using face recognition, location tracking, biometric data, and even DNA testing to stay in control of the country’s populace. In special focus are often more vulnerable groups like ethnic minorities, migrant workers, and those with a history of mental illness.\n\nWorse still is the lack of information about the leak. Chinese officials have not yet made any statements about the breach. It seems that the government is also  blocking information circulating on the web in China about the leak.\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, the vulnerability that enabled the data breach was open for more than a year.While the police records themselves seemed to be stored securely, the dashboard for managing and accessing the data was set up with a public web address and left open without a password, allowing anyone with relatively basic technical knowledge to simply come in and steal the data. \n\nAs of the making of this video, the authenticity of the leak is still being confirmed. At least some of it has checked out, according to The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. \n\nStay up to date with the biggest news in cybersecurity by subscribing to the NordVPN YouTube channel.

A VPN is an essential online privacy tool during your travels. You may encounter various unsafe connections on the road — a VPN encrypts your traffic and protects you from external threats. It also saves you from snoopers checking what you do online (e.g., internet service providers).  \n\n***\n\n🔔 Subscribe to get the latest content: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSZhRxyloC-qzURiOa3vbFQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\n***\n\nContents of the video:\n\n00:00 Intro\n00:19 Why do you need a VPN in Canada?\n01:20 Are VPNs legal in Canada?\n01:25 Other cybersecurity tips\n\n***\n\nPlanning to travel to the Great White North? We are sure you’ll have a great time there, just don’t forget about online safety too. In this video, we will tell you why you should use a VPN in Canada.\n\nWhile Canada doesn’t have rigid online restrictions, internet service providers can still monitor your activities. A VPN encrypts your traffic and protects you from this. No one will be able to see what you do online.\n\nMoreover, internet service providers can also have deals with various streaming services and curb your traffic when you use the other ones. A VPN can also protect you from this as snoopers won’t see which service you’re using when your traffic is encrypted.\n\nYou should also note that Canada is a member of the Five Eyes alliance. That means it monitors your online activities on the state level and can share the data with other member states. \nAnother issue you may encounter there is unsafe public Wi-Fi networks. It’s surely nice to browse or work in cozy coffee shops, but their Wi-Fi spots are usually poorly protected and can be fertile grounds for hackers looking to intercept your traffic and snatch your data. A VPN protects you from all this by encrypting your traffic.\n\n***\n\nAbout NordVPN\n\nNordVPN is part of Nord Security, an online security company that aims to provide users with all the necessary online security tools.

In some cases, it is not malicious and simply enhances your online experience. However, tracking can also be employed for ill purposes — your data can be passed to advertisers without your knowledge, or it can fall into the hands of cybercriminals. \n\nThis video will explain who follows you online and how to minimize internet tracking. You are never alone when browsing — lots of third parties monitor your actions, including ISPs, websites, and cybercriminals. Not all this tracking is equally malicious. Some of it can simply be annoying and slow down your traffic. However, some tracking can result in way more severe damage, such as your data ending in the wrong hands and your privacy being breached.\n\n***\n\n🔔 Subscribe to get the latest content: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSZhRxyloC-qzURiOa3vbFQ?sub_confirmation=1 \n\n***\n\nContents of the video:\n\n00:00 Intro\n00:19 Who tracks you online\n00:16 Internet service provider\n00:52 Websites\n01:35 Data-hoarding services\n02:05 Cybercriminals \n02:33 Browser \n03:09 How to minimize online tracking\n\n***\nWe are not alone when we’re online. And not always in a good sense. Sometimes these invisible companions can be annoying or even dangerous. This video will explain who tracks us online and how to avoid it. So, let’s find out who those snoopers are.\n\nNumber one. Your internet service provider.\n\nYes, your ISP can see what you do online. It can see which websites you visit, what services you use, and all your other unencrypted data like passwords and conversations. ISPs can also see your geolocation when you use a mobile device. Moreover, ISPs can pass your data to third parties or sell it to advertisers — most of us surely don't wish for their private data to end up somewhere without our consent.\n\nNumber two. Websites.\nIndividual websites use a lot of tools to track your behavior and gather as much info about you and your habits as possible. One of the most popular methods is using cookies. And they are not sweet nor delicious. Cookies are small pieces of code that keep track of your requests, identify you as a user, and even track you across different platforms. They help websites target ads according to your browsing habits. In more threatening cases, websites can inject you with even more dangerous stuff, like malware. By prompting you to click on malicious ads or links, they can infect you with bad stuff and keep snatching your data even when you no longer visit them.\n\nNumber three. Data-hoarding services.\nWhile the mentioned tracking techniques usually work in the background without your knowledge, in this case, we contribute to tracking practices ourselves. Facebook and Google know a lot about us by analyzing the data we provide to them — the stuff we search, the things we post, and our overall behavior patterns. By accumulating such a large amount of information, they can bombard us with ads, experiment with various marketing techniques, and even shape our behavior and opinion.\n\nNumber four. Cybercriminals.\n\nCybercriminals are always on the hunt for your private data. And they use various tools to snatch it. They can steal it by intercepting your traffic on public Wi-Fi or track you by using secretly injected stalkerware or keyloggers. They also monitor our publicly available data on social media and other services to sharpen their social engineering skills and trick users into submitting their data or simply guessing their passwords.\n\nNumber five. Your browser.\nYour browser stores cookies and other browsing data. They also employ fingerprinting techniques to collect data about your browser settings and configurations. Such a unique online fingerprint makes it easier for third parties to gather data about you. And it can also be transferred across multiple browsers.\n\n***\nAbout NordVPN\n\nNordVPN is part of Nord Security, an online security company that aims to provide users with all the necessary online security tools.
